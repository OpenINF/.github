The diff indicates that the value at line 6, column 9 needs to be replaced with a plain style scalar as required by the YAML syntax. To achieve this, we need to modify the code in the user_code section.

Here is the modified user_code:

```python
# Sweep AI turns bug fixes & feature requests into code changes (https://sweep.dev)
# For details on our config file, check out our docs at https://docs.sweep.dev
# Reference: https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/blob/main/.github/sweep.yaml.

# If you use this be sure to frequently sync your default branch(main, master) to dev.
branch: 'main'
```

Note that I have added single quotes around the value 'main' to adhere to the YAML syntax rules for plain style scalars.
