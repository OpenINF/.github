Not recommended: The fields are:

## Bold text preceding colon

When non-italic (_roman_) text that precedes a colon is bold, make the colon
bold too.

## Code text preceding colon

When text that precedes a colon is tagged as `<code>`, don't include the colon
in the `<code>` tagging unless it is part of the code. For more information
about formatting code, see [Some specific items to put in code font].

In general, the first word in the text that follows a colon should be in

that it's warranted.
