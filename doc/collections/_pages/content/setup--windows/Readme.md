# Windows Server Workstation Setup

This section deals with preparing devices for (and installing) Windows
Server as the host OS for modern software development workstations.

Although using Windows may not be a requirement for contributions, many have
made the conscious decision not to go with the more common locked-down option
of Apple products. Oftentimes, the hardware associated with the machine has
the most compatibility with drivers specifically made for Windows while
Linux driver support may be limited or non-existent in some cases.
