The OpenINF `.github` repository is a one-stop shop for default metadata and
community health files for all [**@OpenINF**][] projects on GitHub. If a file
does not exist for a specific project, these organization-wide defaults will be
used. We are constantly working to improve this repository, so please feel free
to [contribute](#contributing) if you notice any omissions or errors.

Thanks!

While these files themselves won't appear in the file browser or Git history of
each repository, they will be surfaced throughout developers' workflows, such as
when opening a new issue or when viewing the project's [Community Profile][],
just as if it were committed to the repository directly.[^1]

We cannot create organization-wide defaults for the following files as they are
often unique per project. Therefore, they must be added to each individual
repository so that they will be included when the project is cloned, packaged,
or downloaded. Refer to the ones contained in this repository for guidance on
how these files are expected to look.

<br /><div align="center">

| File name        | Title               | Description                                                             |
| :--------------- | :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`AUTHORS`][]    | The OpenINF Authors | Lists the contributors of their respective project repositories[^2][^3] |
| [`README.md`][]  | Homepage            | Serves as a project landing page of sorts                               |
| [`LICENSE.md`][] | Software License(s) | The open source software license(s) associated with a project           |
| [`VISION.md`][]  | Project Vision      | The goal(s) and/or scope of a project                                   |

The [`VISION.md`][] file can be useful for offloading project goals that should
typically be specified in the root [`README.md`][] file. It may optionally exist
alongside it as an alternative location to even include project scope as well,
but should be linked to from the root [`README.md`][] file in these cases.
